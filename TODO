* Add real balance sheet and income statement reports
* Implement "delete"
* Implement "unpost all" to fix journal/posting errors
* Check for spellchecker type (currently uses ispell)
* Add feature for external programs to easily post data into the journal
  This was something I intended to do in 2003, but there wasn't an 
  immediate need for it, so it got shelved.
* Update comments, clean up code 
* Make a real man page and docs
